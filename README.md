# Udacity - Intermediate Python
This repository contains some of the exercises and all projects necessary for me to complete the Data Analyst nanodegree by Udacity. There were two main modules/lessons to this module and each are completed using Python:

   * The Advanced Python Techniques module where I learned in more detail about the primitive data types in python, python's data structures, functional programming, object-oriented programming and file I/O.

   * The Large Codebases with Libraries module where I learned how to build python packages and modules and manage large python projects. So, essentially learn how to build python packages/modules, use python virtual environments and how to manage a project with many dependencies.

All projects for this module will be explained in the Projects section.

# Projects

   *  ## Project 1

      Using the description from Udacity:

      ### Overview
      At a high-level, you'll create Python code that implements a command-line tool to inspect and query a dataset of NEOs and their close approaches to Earth.

      Concretely, you'll have to read data from both a CSV file and a JSON file, convert that data into structured Python objects, perform filtering operations on the data, limit the size of the result set, and write the results to a file in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON.

      When complete, you'll be able to inspect the properties of the near-Earth objects in the data set and query the data set of close approaches to Earth using any combination of the following filters:

      * Occurs on a given date.
      * Occurs on or after a given start date.
      * Occurs on or before a given end date.
      * Approaches Earth at a distance of at least (or at most) X astrononical units.
      * Approaches Earth at a relative velocity of at least (or at most) kilometers per second.
      * Has a diameter that is at least as large as (or at least as small as) Z kilometers.
      * Is marked by NASA as potentially hazardous (or not).

  * ## Project 2
    The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator" – a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. It’s not that simple though! Your content team spent countless hours writing quotes in a variety of filetypes. You could manually copy and paste these quotes into one standard format – but you’re going to over-engineer a solution to load quotes from each file to show off your fancy new Python skills.
